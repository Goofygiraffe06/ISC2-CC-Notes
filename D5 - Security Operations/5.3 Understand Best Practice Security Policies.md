- **Appropriate use of data**: The policy defines how data is to be used within an organization. Some data may be restricted to specific roles, or it could be made public to anyone outside the organization.
- **Legal usage definitions**: Some data has legal usage definitions that must be adhered to. The organization's policy should clearly outline these restrictions or provide a reference to the legal definitions.
- **Compliance with laws and regulations**: Proper data classification can assist an organization in maintaining compliance with relevant laws and regulations. For instance, classifying credit card data as confidential can help ensure compliance with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS).
- **Encryption requirements**: The data classification policy should clearly define the requirements for data encryption. For instance, if credit card information is classified as confidential, the policy should require that such data be encrypted as per PCI DSS specifications.

# 5.3.2 Password Policy 

- Every organization should establish a **password policy** that outlines the expectations for systems and users regarding password usage.
- The password policy should express the **commitment of senior leadership** to maintain secure access to data.
- The policy should also include any **standards that the organization has adopted for creating passwords**. This could include rules on password length, complexity, and expiration.
- The policy should clearly identify **who is responsible for enforcing and validating the policy**. This ensures accountability and that the policy is consistently upheld.

# 5.3.3 Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)

- The Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) outlines the **approved usage of an organization's assets**, which includes IT infrastructure, devices, and data.
- AUP aids in **protecting the organization from legal repercussions**.
- Every employee or anyone with access to the organization's assets should be required to **sign a copy of the AUP**, ideally in the presence of another organizational employee. Both parties should keep a copy of the signed AUP.
- Common aspects usually covered in AUPs are:
    - Data access
    - System access
    - Data disclosure
    - Password management
    - Data retention policies
    - Internet usage rules
    - Guidelines for company device usage.

# 5.3.4 Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) Policy

- **Bring Your Own Device (BYOD)** policy allows employees to use their personal devices for work purposes. This could include laptops, smartphones, tablets, etc.
- While BYOD can boost employee morale due to familiarity and comfort with their own devices, it poses significant challenges to the security team. The challenges stem from a loss of control over standardization and privacy.
- BYOD increases the risk of data breaches, as personal devices may not adhere to the company's security standards. They may harbor vulnerabilities or backdoors that can be exploited.
- In the case of a forensic audit, inspecting personal devices can be problematic due to privacy issues.
- It is crucial for organizations implementing a BYOD policy to establish clear user expectations and business rules. All employees must read and agree to adhere to this policy before they can access the company's systems, network, and data.
- As the workforce and the number of devices grow, the management and security around BYOD devices also become increasingly complex. Therefore, appropriate tools are required to manage and secure BYOD devices effectively.

# 5.3.5 Privacy Policy 

- The organizationâ€™s privacy policy should define what is considered PII/ePHI. It should also detail appropriate handling procedures and mechanisms, user expectations, enforcement mechanisms, and punitive measures for non-compliance.
- The privacy policy should reference applicable regulations and legislation, which may vary based on geographical location or specific industry. Examples include the GDPR in the EU, PIPEDA in Canada, HIPAA, and GLBA in the US.
- The organization should create a public document detailing how it uses and protects private information. This includes both internal and external uses. In certain cases, such as with medical providers, this document may need to be presented to patients or be easily accessible (e.g., on the provider's website).

# 5.3.6 Change Management Policy 

- Change management is a discipline that guides how we prepare, equip, and support individuals to successfully adopt change to drive organizational success and outcomes.
- It comprises three main activities: making the decision to implement a change, executing the change, and confirming that the change has been correctly carried out.
- Change management focuses on the decision-making process, which results in giving approvals to system support teams, developers, and end users to implement the proposed changes.
- Any changes made to a system, its individual components, or its operating environment throughout the system's lifecycle can potentially introduce new vulnerabilities, thus threatening the security of the enterprise.
- Therefore, change management necessitates a structured process to implement changes in a way that minimizes adverse impacts on business operations.

## Components 

### Request For Change (RFC) 

1. Change management starts with a Request for Change (RFC). This could be due to an identified need for system enhancement, to rectify a detected problem, or to introduce new functionality.
2. The proposed change then progresses through different stages including development, testing, and final approval stages. Each of these stages involves various checks and balances to ensure that the change will not disrupt existing processes or introduce vulnerabilities.
3. Each stage in the change management process requires formalized management and decision-making. This is to ensure the change is necessary, feasible, and aligns with the organization's strategic goals.
4. Every step in the change management process is documented. This includes logging the initial RFC, tracking its progress through the various stages, and recording the final implementation of the change.
5. Documentation serves multiple purposes: it provides accountability, allows for auditability, aids in troubleshooting any issues that arise due to the change, and contributes to organizational learning.
6. Once a change has been fully tested and approved, it is then released to the end users. User training may be part of this final step, especially if the change significantly affects system usage or workflows.
7. Post-implementation reviews are typically conducted to assess the effectiveness of the change, and any lessons learned are incorporated into future change management processes.
   
### Approval 

1. **Evaluating Request for Changes (RFCs) for Completeness:** This involves assessing if the RFC contains all the necessary information including the purpose of the change, the components that will be affected, a detailed plan of the change, and potential risks involved.
2. **Assignment to Proper Change Authorization Process:** Depending on the complexity and risk associated with the change, it is assigned to the appropriate change authorization process. This is determined based on risk assessments and established organizational practices.
3. **Stakeholder Reviews:** All relevant stakeholders are involved in the review process. This could include departments that are affected by the change, IT teams responsible for implementing the change, and management who have to approve the change.
4. **Resource Identification and Allocation:** This step involves determining what resources will be required to implement the change and ensuring they are allocated appropriately. Resources could include personnel, equipment, or software.
5. **Appropriate Approvals or Rejections:** Once the change has been thoroughly reviewed and tested, it must be either approved or rejected by the relevant authorities in the organization. This decision is documented for future reference.
6. **Documentation of Approval or Rejection:** Regardless of whether the change is approved or rejected, the decision, along with its reasoning, is recorded. This helps in maintaining a history of changes, which can be beneficial for future change management activities.

### Rollback 

1. **Scheduling the Change:** The proposed change needs to be scheduled for a time that minimizes disruption to the ongoing operations of the organization.
2. **Testing the Change:** The change is tested in a controlled environment to ensure it works as expected and doesn't introduce any new issues or vulnerabilities.
3. **Verifying the Rollback Procedures:** In case the change doesn't work as expected or introduces new issues, a rollback procedure should be in place. This procedure is verified to ensure it can effectively restore the system to its pre-change state.
4. **Implementing the Change:** After thorough testing and verification of the rollback procedure, the change is implemented in the production environment.
5. **Evaluating the Change:** Post-implementation, the change is evaluated to ensure it operates properly and effectively, and provides the intended benefits.
6. **Documenting the Change in the Production Environment:** Detailed documentation of the change, including its nature, implementation process, and effects, is maintained. This helps in tracking changes over time and assists in troubleshooting any issues that may arise in the future.
7. **Rollback Authority:** The authority to roll back a change should it not perform as expected is defined in the rollback plan. The rollback may be immediate or scheduled as a subsequent change based on the monitoring of the change's performance.

## Compliance 

- Consequences for violating company policies should be clearly laid out and may include warnings, suspensions, or even termination depending on the severity of the violation.
- The details of these policies should be thoroughly explained during employee onboarding, especially for those working in information security roles.
- The responsibility for enforcing these policies should be clearly defined and known to all employees.
- As part of the onboarding process, employees should sign documentation indicating they understand and agree to comply with these policies.
- To ensure understanding, a short survey or quiz could be implemented to test employee comprehension of the policies.
- All security and data handling procedures should be supported by comprehensive policies, which contribute to an organization's baseline security posture.
