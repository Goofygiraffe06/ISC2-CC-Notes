Also used to refer to taking any set of data and packaging it or hiding it in another data structure, as is common in network protocols and encryption.
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- **Hardware** - The physical parts of a computer and related devices.
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- **Hybrid cloud** - A combination of public cloud storage and private cloud storage where some critical data resides in the enterprise’s private cloud while other data is stored and accessible from a public cloud storage provider.
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)** - The provider of the core computing, storage and network hardware and software that is the foundation upon which organizations can build and then deploy applications.  IaaS is popular in the data center where software and servers are purchased as a fully outsourced service and usually billed on usage and how much of the resource is used.
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- **Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)** - An IP network protocol standardized by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) through RFC 792 to determine if a particular service or host is available.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- **Microsegmentation** - Part of a zero-trust strategy that breaks LANs into very small, highly localized zones using firewalls or similar technologies. At the limit, this places firewall at every connection point.
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- **Oversized Packet Attack** - Purposely sending a network packet that is larger than expected or larger than can be handled by the receiving system, causing the receiving system to fail unexpectedly.
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- **Packet** - Representation of data at Layer 3 of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model.
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- **Payload** - The primary action of a malicious code attack.
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- **Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)** - An information security standard administered by the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council that applies to merchants and service providers who process credit or debit card transactions.
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- **Platform as a Service (PaaS)** - The web-authoring or application development middleware environment that allows applications to be built in the cloud before they’re deployed as SaaS assets.
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- **Private cloud** - The phrase used to describe a cloud computing platform that is implemented within the corporate firewall, under the control of the IT department. A private cloud is designed to offer the same features and benefits of cloud systems, but removes a number of objections to the cloud computing model, including control over enterprise and customer data, worries about security, and issues connected to regulatory compliance.
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- **Protocols** - A set of rules (formats and procedures) to implement and control some type of association (that is, communication) between systems. NIST SP 800-82 Rev. 2
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- **Public cloud** - The cloud infrastructure is provisioned for open use by the general public. It may be owned, managed, and operated by a business, academic, or government organization, or some combination of them. It exists on the premises of the cloud provider. NIST SP 800-145

- **Software** - Computer programs and associated data that may be dynamically written or modified during execution. NIST SP 80-37 Rev. 2
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- **Software as a Service (SaaS)** - The cloud customer uses the cloud provider’s applications running within a cloud infrastructure. The applications are accessible from various client devices through either a thin client interface, such as a web browser or a program interface. The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure including network, servers, operating systems, storage, or even individual application capabilities, with the possible exception of limited user-specific application configuration settings.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- **Wireless Area Network (WLAN)** - A group of computers and devices that are located in the same vicinity, forming a network based on radio transmissions rather than wired connections. A Wi-Fi is network is a type of WLAN.
