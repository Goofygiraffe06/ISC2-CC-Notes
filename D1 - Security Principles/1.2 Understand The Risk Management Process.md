## 1.2.1 Risk

It is  the **measure of** the extent to which an **entity is threatened** by a potential circumstance or event. It is often expressed as a combination of:

1.  The adverse impacts that would arise if the circumstance or event occurs.
2.  The likelihood of occurrence.

## Information Security Risk

- This reflects the potential adverse impacts that result from the possibility of unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification or destruction of information and/or information systems.
- It represents the risk associated with threat, likelihood and impact and IT risk is subset of business risk.

## Asset

It is something that is in need of protection.

## Vulnerability

It is a **gap or weakness** in an organization's protection of sensitive or classified assets including information, if triggered or acted upon, could cause a risk event to occur.

## Threat 

It is something or someone that aims to exploit a vulnerability to gain unauthorized access. The various types of threat actors such as: 
- **Insiders** (either deliberately, by simple human error, or by gross incompetence).
- **Outside individuals** or informal groups (either planned or opportunistic, discovering vulnerability).
- **Formal entities** that are nonpolitical (such as business competitors and cyber criminals).
- **Formal entities that are political** (such as terrorists, nation-states, and hacktivists).
- **Intelligence or information gatherers** (could be any of the above).
- **Technology** (such as free-running bots and artificial intelligence, which could be part of any of the above).

## 1.2.2 Risk Identification, Assessment and Treatment

## Risk Identification 

- It is defined as the process of identifying, estimating and prioritizing risks to an organization’s operations.
- It is a **recurring process** of identifying different possible risk, characterizing them and estimating the potential for disruption of an organization.
- It involves looking at your unique company and analyzing its unique situation.
- Identify risk to communicate it clearly. 
- Employees at all levels of the organization are responsible for identifying risk.
- Identify risk to protect against it.
- A risk assessment can prioritize items for management to determine the method of mitigation that best suits the assets being protected.
- The result of the risk assessment process is often documented as a report or presentation given to management for their use in prioritizing the identified risk(s).
- This report is **provided to management** for review and approval.

## Risk Treatment 

It relates to making decisions about best actions to take regarding the identified or prioritized risk. The **decision made will depend upon the attitude of the management** towards the risk, availability and cost of risk mitigation 

### Risk Avoidance 

-  It is decision to attempt to **eliminate the risk** entirely.
- This could include ceasing operation for some or all of the activities of the organization that are exposed to a particular risk.
- This option is considered when the impact or likelihood of the risk is simply too high or great. 

### Risk Acceptance

- Risk acceptance is taking **no action to reduce the likelihood of a risk** occurring.
- This option is considered when the risk and likelihood of the risk is negligible.

### Risk Mitigation 

- Risk mitigation is the most common type of risk management and includes **taking actions to prevent or reduce the possibility of a risk** event or its impact.
- Mitigation can involve remediation measures, or controls, such as security controls, establishing policies, procedures, and standards to minimize adverse risk.
- Risk **cannot always be mitigated**, but mitigation such as safety measures should always be in place.

### Risk Transference 

- Risk transference is the practice of **passing the risk to another party (generally Insurance Companies)**.
- Who will accept the financial impact of the harm resulting from a risk being realized in exchange for payment. Typically, this is an insurance policy.

##  Risk Priorities

- When risks have been identified, it is time to prioritize and analyze core risks through qualitative risk (A type of risk analysis where the impact of the risk is given by low,medium, high and severe) analysis and/or quantitative risk analysis (A type of risk analysis where the impact of the risk is given by numerical values).
- This is necessary to determine root cause and narrow down apparent risks and core risks.
- One effective method to prioritize risk is to **use a risk matrix**, which helps identify priority as the intersection of likelihood of occurrence and impact.
- It also gives the team a common language to use with management when determining the final priorities.
