- Security controls pertain to the physical, technical and administrative mechanisms that act as **safeguards or countermeasures** prescribed for an information system to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the system and its information. 
- The implementation of controls should reduce risk, hopefully **to an acceptable level**.

## 1.3.1 Administrative Controls 

- It is also known as managerial controls.
- These controls are **directives, guidelines or advisories** aimed at the people within the organization.
- They provide **frameworks, constraints and standards** for human behavior, and should cover the entire scope of the organization’s activities and its interactions with external parties and stakeholders.
- Administrative controls can and should be powerful, effective tools for achieving information security.
- These and other techniques bring the policies to a more neutral level and away from the decision-making of only the senior executives. 
- It also makes them immediate, useful and operational on a daily and per-task basis.

## 1.3.2 Technical Controls 

- It is also known as logical controls.
- They are security controls that computer systems and networks directly implement.
- These controls can provide **automated protection again unauthorized access** or misuse or any other threat and support security requirements for application and data.
- They can be configuration settings or parameters of data, or they can be hardware setting/protection like switches etc.
- The implementation of technical controls always requires significant operational considerations and should be consistent with the management of security within the organization.

## 1.3.3 Physical Controls

- They follow process based security needs using physical devices like badge reader, architectural features etc.
- They provide ways to **control and direct movement of people** and equipment from physical location.
- Physical controls also provide protection and control over entry onto the land surrounding the buildings, parking lots or other areas that are within the organization’s control.
- Physical controls are **supported by technical controls** as a means of incorporating them into an overall security system.
