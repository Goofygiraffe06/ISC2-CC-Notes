- **Business Continuity (BC)**: Actions, processes and tools for ensuring an organization can continue critical operations during a contingency. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- **Business Continuity Plan (BCP)**: The documentation of a predetermined set of instructions or procedures that describe how an organization’s mission/business processes will be sustained during and after a significant disruption.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- **Business Impact Analysis (BIA)**: An analysis of an information system’s requirements, functions, and inter-dependencies used to characterize system contingency requirements and priorities in the event of a significant disruption. [Reference](https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/business-impact-analysis)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- **Disaster Recovery (DR)**: In information systems terms, the activities necessary to restore IT and communications services to an organization during and after an outage, disruption or disturbance of any kind or scale. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- **Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP)**: The processes, policies and procedures related to preparing for recovery or continuation of an organization's critical business functions, technology infrastructure, systems and applications after the organization experiences a disaster. A disaster is when an organization’s critical business function(s) cannot be performed at an acceptable level within a predetermined period following a disruption.

- **Event**: Any observable occurrence in a network or system. Source: NIST SP 800-61 Rev2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- **Exploit**: A particular attack. It is named this way because these attacks exploit system vulnerabilities.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- **Incident**: An event that actually or potentially jeopardizes the confidentiality, integrity or availability of an information system or the information the system processes, stores or transmits. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- **Incident Handling**: The mitigation of violations of security policies and recommended practices. Source: NIST SP 800-61 Rev 2

- **Intrusion**: A security event, or combination of security events, that constitutes a security incident in which an intruder gains, or attempts to gain, access to a system or system resource without authorization. Source: IETF RFC 4949 Ver 2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- **Security Operations Center**: A centralized organizational function fulfilled by an information security team that monitors, detects and analyzes events on the network or system to prevent and resolve issues before they result in business disruptions.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- **Vulnerability**: Weakness in an information system, system security procedures, internal controls or implementation that could be exploited or triggered by a threat source. Source: NIST SP 800-128. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- **Zero Day**: A previously unknown system vulnerability with the potential of exploitation without risk of detection or prevention because it does not, in general, fit recognized patterns, signatures or methods.
