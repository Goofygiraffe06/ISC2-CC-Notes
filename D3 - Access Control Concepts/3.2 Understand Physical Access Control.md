A control is a safeguard or countermeasure designed to preserve Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability of data. This, of course, is the CIA Triad.  

- A control is a safeguard or countermeasure designed to preserve Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability of data (CIA Triad).
- Access control involves limiting what objects can be available to what subjects according to what rules.
- One brief example of a control is a firewall, which is included in a system or network to prevent external disturbances or compromises.

Physical access controls are tangible measures designed to prevent, monitor, or detect direct contact with systems or areas within a facility but also to protect the health and safety of the personnel inside. They include:

- Security guards
- Fences
- Motion detectors
- Locked doors/gates
- Sealed windows
- Lights
- Cable protection
- **Laptop locks**
- Badges
- Swipe cards
- Guard dogs
- Cameras
- Man traps/turnstiles
- Alarms

- Physical access controls are crucial for safeguarding a company's assets, especially its most important asset - its people.
- When implementing physical access controls, the security and safety of personnel take top priority, followed by securing other physical assets.

### 3.1.1 Physical Security Controls 

Physical security controls for human traffic are often implemented using various technologies, such as:

- Turnstiles
- Man traps
- Remotely or system-controlled door locks

**Access Control System and Enrollment**

- To identify an authorized employee, an access control system requires an enrollment station to assign and activate an access control device.
- Most often, a badge is produced and issued with the employee's identifiers, granting access to specific areas.
- In high-security environments, enrollment may include bio-metric characteristics.
- The access control system compares an individual's badge against a verified database to authenticate the person.
- If authenticated, the access control system sends output signals allowing authorized personnel to pass through gates or doors to controlled areas.
- The systems are typically integrated with the organization's logging systems to document access activity, both authorized and unauthorized.

**Types of Access Control Cards**

A range of card types allows the system to be used in different environments. These cards include:

- Bar code
- Magnetic stripe
- Proximity
- Smart
- Hybrid

## 3.1.2 Monitoring

The use of physical access controls and monitoring personnel and equipment entering and leaving as well as auditing/logging all physical events are primary elements in maintaining overall organizational security.

### Cameras

- Cameras are integrated into the security program and centrally monitored, providing surveillance and deterrence.
- They can detect activities when combined with other sensors and provide valuable evidence if recorded.
- Motion sensor technologies augment their capabilities for monitoring the external perimeter.
- Properly integrated exterior sensors alert organizations to potential intruders.

### Logs 

- Physical logs are records of events that have occurred, such as sign-in sheets maintained by security guards or logs from electronic systems managing physical access.
- Physical security logs are essential for supporting business requirements, compliance with regulations, and forensic investigations.
- Logs must be protected from manipulation and unauthorized disclosure, especially if they contain sensitive data about customers or users.
- Organizations should establish guidelines for log retention and regularly review logs as part of their security program.
- Identifying log anomalies is crucial for detecting security-related issues during audits and routine monitoring.
- Different economies, countries, and industries may have varying business and legal requirements for log retention.
- The legal department should be consulted to determine the appropriate log retention period if there are no specific business or legal requirements.

### Security Guards 

- Security guards are a highly effective physical security control.
- Regardless of the type of physical access control used, the presence of security guards or monitoring systems serves as a deterrent.
- Security guards discourage individuals from attempting to masquerade as someone else or tailgating closely behind authorized personnel to gain unauthorized access.
- Their presence helps prevent theft and abuse of equipment or sensitive information.

### Alarm Systems 

- Alarm systems are commonly used on doors and windows in homes and office buildings.
- They are designed to alert appropriate personnel when a door or window is opened unexpectedly.
- For authorized access, employees may use codes or badges without triggering an alarm.
- Unauthorized access, such as brute force entry, will activate the alarm.
- Fire alarm systems are another type of alarm, activated by heat or smoke, sounding an audible warning and notifying local response personnel and fire departments.
- Panic buttons are used to alert police or security personnel when activated in emergency situations.
